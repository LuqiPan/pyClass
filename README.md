pyClass

### pyClass

To run my interpreter on a python source file, simply run 'python pyClass.py source.py false' on `.py` files. The last argument is a debug printing flag.

### Test

run `python test.py` to compare my interpreter against Python interpreter. My tests mainly look at the result of stdout(artifacts of `print` statement)
